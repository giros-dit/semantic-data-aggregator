1) Uploads a jar to the cluster. The jar must be sent as multi-part data. Make sure that the "Content-Type" header is set to "application/x-java-archive", as some http libraries do not add the header by default. Using 'curl' you can upload a jar via 'curl -X POST -H "Expect:" -F "jarfile=@path/to/flink-job.jar" http://hostname:port/jars/upload'.

Example:

curl -X POST -H "Expect:" -F "jarfile=@flink-conf/flink-kafka-uc1/target/flinkkafka-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" http://localhost:8084/jars/upload

2) Returns a list of all jars previously uploaded via '/jars/upload'.

Example:

curl -X GET http://localhost:8084/jars

3) Submits a job by running a jar previously uploaded via '/jars/upload'. Program arguments can be passed both via the JSON request (recommended) or query parameters.

jarid - String value that identifies a jar. When uploading the jar a path is returned, where the filename is the ID. This value is equivalent to the `id` field in the list of uploaded jars (/jars).

entry-class (optional): String value that specifies the fully qualified name of the entry point class. Overrides the class defined in the jar file manifest.

Example:

curl -X POST http://localhost:8084/jars/c9c6063e-a8e1-4839-9972-5cf48b7db998_flinkkafka-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar/run?entry-class=flinkkafka.TrafficAvg

4) Cancel/Stop flink job.

Example:

curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8084/jobs/dc6dcc99b55184a40e2c0390559a3b84?mode=cancel

5) Returns an overview over all jobs and their current state.

Example:

curl -X GET http://localhost9:8084/jobs

6) Provides access to aggregated job metrics.

9) Returns the list of log files on the JobManager.
